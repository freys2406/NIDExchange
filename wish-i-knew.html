    <div id="housing" class="section">
        <h2>Housing</h2>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Accommodation Details</h3>
            <p>Exchange students have the option to stay in the NID hostel. Housing information is shared very last-minute, so be prepared for uncertainty.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Campus Environment</h3>
            <p class="host-grotesk"> The campus is home to many animals—you’ll see dogs, monkeys, and peacocks regularly. If you love animals, it’s great. But if you’re scared of them, it may take time to adjust.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div id="food" class="section">
        <h2>Food</h2>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Eating on Campus</h3>
            <p>If you’re staying in the hostel, the best option is to pay for the mess (cafeteria), where most students eat daily. It’s a simple, cost-effective option with vegetarian meals.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Eating Outside</h3>
            <p>Street food and local restaurants are super cheap, delicious, and part of the cultural experience!
                Western-style cafés and restaurants are available but can be expensive.
                Ahmedabad has a mix of budget-friendly and high-end dining, so spending depends on your preferences.
                </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Spice and Oil Warning</h3>
            <p>Indian food is spicy and oily, so be prepared for that!
                It’s a big part of the experience, but if you have a sensitive stomach, take it slow and ease into the flavors.
                You can ask for less spicy options at some places, but spice is a big part of local cuisine.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div id="academics" class="section">
        <h2>Academics</h2>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Course Selection and Learning Plan</h3>
            <p>You are free to choose any courses from any discipline, which is amazing for flexibility.
                However, no faculty will guide you—you have to decide and enroll on your own.
                Getting access to available courses before arrival would help in planning.
                A sample learning plan across disciplines would be useful for understanding NID’s academic structure.
                </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Travel and Course Planning</h3>
            <p> Courses, timetables, and curriculum details are not provided in advance.
                You’ll need to actively follow up with the exchange office for details.Exchange students are free to travel as long as they choose courses that allow breaks.
                Everything depends on talking to faculty—most are open to discussing flexible schedules if you plan in advance.
                India is amazing to travel from December to February, with great weather—take advantage of it!</p>
        </div>

    <div id="transport" class="section">
        <h2>Transport</h2>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Ride-Hailing Apps</h3>
            <p>Uber and Ola (Indian versions of Uber) are the easiest ways to get around.
                Prices fluctuate based on demand, so rides can be cheap or expensive depending on the time. You can get around cheaply or in luxury, depending on how much you want to spend.
                High-end taxis and cars are available for a premium price, while local transport is much cheaper.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Local Taxis and Rickshaws</h3>
            <p>Auto-rickshaws (tuk-tuks) are common, but you must bargain—drivers often quote higher prices to foreigners.
                Ask local students about fair prices before taking a ride. Ahmedabad has buses and a metro, but they can be confusing and crowded for first-timers.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div id="budgeting" class="section">
        <h2>Budgeting</h2>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Cost of Living</h3>
            <p>If you’re staying in the hostel, your biggest expenses will be hostel fees and the mess (cafeteria).
                Outside of that, India is very affordable, and daily expenses are low compared to Western countries.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Cash vs. Digital Payments</h3>
            <p>UPI, Google Pay, and Paytm are widely used, so digital payments are easy.
                Some small vendors still prefer cash, so keep some small bills handy.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div id="social-life" class="section">
        <h2>Social Life</h2>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Campus Culture</h3>
            <p>NID is a very friendly, welcoming space, and students are open to exchange students.
                There’s always something happening—social events, student clubs, and casual hangouts.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Festivals and Fun Events</h3>
            <p>Holi: A massive color festival—prepare to get messy and have fun!
                Pongal: A South Indian festival with food and cultural performances.
                Convocation: A grand celebration with exhibitions and events.
                BBC League: A big inter-discipline sports tournament—even if you don’t play, it’s fun to watch and cheer!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Navigating Cultural Differnces</h3>
            <p>People are very friendly, but you might notice occasional moments where you’re treated differently as a foreigner.
                It’s not hostility—mostly just curiosity or lack of exposure to foreigners.
                A positive attitude and open mind go a long way!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Dress Code and Safety</h3>
            <p>Western wear is fine on campus, but Ahmedabad (and India in general) is more conservative.
                Revealing outfits (short shorts, crop tops, low-cut tops) may attract unwanted attention in the city.
                NID is a safe space, but outside campus, it’s good to dress modestly, especially when using public transport or visiting local areas.
                Ahmedabad is generally safe, but always be aware of your surroundings, especially if traveling alone at night.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Fireworks and Riverfront</h3>
            <p>The Riverfront area has fireworks at night, which can be very loud in the hostel rooms.
                If you’re a light sleeper, bring earplugs.</p>
